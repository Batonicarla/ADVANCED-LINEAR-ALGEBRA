1. Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful dimensionality reduction technique used to transform a large set of variables into a smaller one that still contains most of the information in the large set. This project applies PCA to a dataset focused on CO2 emissions in Africa to identify the most significant underlying components that explain the variance in the data.

2. Dataset Overview
The dataset co2 Emission Africa.csv contains various features related to CO2 emissions, population, GDP, area, and different emission sources across African countries over several years. Initially, the dataset had 17 numeric features after handling non-numeric columns and missing values.

Initial Data Shape: (1134, 20) (Original) Cleaned Numeric Data Shape: (1134, 17) (After imputation and selection of numeric columns)

3. PCA Steps Implemented
Step 1: Load and Standardize the Data
The dataset was loaded using pandas.
Non-numeric columns (Country, Sub-Region, Code) were identified. Sub-Region was one-hot encoded, and Country and Code were not included in PCA to avoid high cardinality issues.
Missing values in numeric columns were handled using mean imputation.
The cleaned numeric data was standardized (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) using NumPy to ensure all features contribute equally to the PCA.
Step 2: Calculate the Covariance Matrix
The covariance matrix of the standardized data was computed. This matrix captures the relationships between all pairs of features.
A heatmap of the covariance matrix was generated to visually inspect feature correlations.
Step 3: Perform Eigendecomposition
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix were calculated using NumPy's np.linalg.eig function.
Number of Eigenvalues: 17
Eigenvectors Shape: (17, 17)
Step 4: Sort Principal Components & Calculate Explained Variance
Eigenvalues were sorted in descending order, and the corresponding eigenvectors were reordered accordingly. This ensures that the principal components are ordered by their importance (amount of variance explained).
Total Variance (sum of eigenvalues): 17.0000
Explained Variance Ratios:
PC1: 51.22%
PC2: 13.53%
PC3: 9.50%
... (and so on for subsequent PCs)
Cumulative Explained Variance:
80% variance achieved with 4 components (82.46% cumulative)
90% variance achieved with 6 components (92.20% cumulative)
95% variance achieved with 7 components (95.27% cumulative)
Step 5: Project Data onto Principal Components
Based on the 95% cumulative variance threshold (a standard practice in PCA), 7 principal components were selected.
The standardized data was projected onto these selected principal components to create the reduced-dimensional dataset.
Original Data Shape: (1134, 17)
Reduced Data Shape: (1134, 7)
Dimensionality Reduction: 17 features → 7 features
Reduction Rate: 58.8% fewer dimensions
Step 6: Visualize Before and After PCA
Before PCA: A scatter plot of the first two original standardized features (Year vs Population) was generated, showing the initial data distribution.
After PCA: A scatter plot of the first two principal components (PC1 vs PC2) was generated, demonstrating how the data is represented in the new, uncorrelated feature space.
PC1 captures 51.2% of total variance.
PC2 captures 13.5% of total variance.
Together, PC1 and PC2 capture 64.7% of the total variance.
4. Key Findings & Justification for Component Selection
Justification for selecting 7 Principal Components:

Eigenvalue Ordering (Critical!): Eigenvalues were sorted in descending order, ensuring that PC1 captures the maximum variance, PC2 the second most, and so on. This foundational step is crucial for the validity of PCA.

Scree Plot Analysis (Elbow Method): The scree plot showed a sharp "elbow" around PC3. While indicating diminishing returns after this point, it suggests that a few components capture a significant portion of the variance.

Cumulative Variance Threshold (Standard Practice): The decision to select 7 components was primarily driven by the 95% cumulative explained variance threshold, which is widely considered a gold standard in PCA for retaining sufficient information while achieving significant dimensionality reduction. These 7 components collectively explain 95.27% of the total variance, meaning only 4.73% of the information is lost, which is an acceptable trade-off.

Dimensionality Reduction Achieved: The process successfully reduced the dataset from 17 features to 7, resulting in a 58.8% reduction in dimensionality. This reduction offers benefits such as faster computation, reduced risk of overfitting, and easier visualization and interpretation of the data.

5. Conclusion
By applying PCA, we have effectively transformed the original 17-dimensional dataset into a 7-dimensional representation, retaining over 95% of the original variance. This reduced dataset can now be used for subsequent machine learning tasks, offering benefits in computational efficiency and potentially improved model performance by mitigating the curse of dimensionality.
